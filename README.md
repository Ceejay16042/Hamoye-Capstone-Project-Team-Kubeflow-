# HamoyeAI-Team-Kubeflow-Capstone-Project
## Predicting School Completion Rates in Developing Countries

### This project was carried out by the members of Team Kubeflow for Hamoye's intern capstone project.

###During the phase of this project, the following operations were executed:

+ Data sourcing from Unesco http://sdg4-data.uis.unesco.org/
  
+ Data cleaning to ensure quality data, increase to the  overall productivity, and allow for the highest quality information in your decision-making.

+ Exploratory data analysis was conducted to gain insights into the high-contributing factors that lead to reduced completion rates in various sub-levels of education

+ Feature engineering was performed on the UNESCO dataset to enhance model performance, address potential non-linearity in the model, and apply feature scaling.

+ Model building to predict the completion of schools in different sub-levels of education

+ Deploying the best performing model on the streamlit app
